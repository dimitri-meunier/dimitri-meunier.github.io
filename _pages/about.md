I currently hold a research intern position at CREST (Center for Research in Economics and Statistics) for a remote collaboration with the Approximate Bayesian Inference Team at RIKEN AIP, working with Pierre Alquier and Emtiyaz Khan.
Prior to that, I received a MSc in Statistics from ENSAE Institut Polytechnique de Paris and a MRes in Mathematics and Machine Learning (MVA Master) from ENS Paris-Saclay.
My main research interests lie in variational inference for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Kernel methods, next experiments ...
You can find in my master thesis.
