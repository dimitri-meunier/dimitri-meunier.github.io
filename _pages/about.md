I currently hold a research intern position at the [Center for Research in Economics and Statistics](http://crest.science "CREST") at [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) for a remote collaboration with the [Approximate Bayesian Inference Team](https://team-approx-bayes.github.io "ApproxBayesTeam") of the [RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project](https://aip.riken.jp "RikenAIP") in Tokyo, Japan, working with [Pierre Alquier](https://pierrealquier.github.io) and [Emtiyaz Khan](https://emtiyaz.github.io). This year I graduated the Master [MVA](http://math.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/) (Machine Learning and Computer Vision) from [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) and obtained the engineering degree of [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) specialising in Statistics. Prior to that, I received a BSc in Mathematics from the [Université Paris Dauphine](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/) and spent a great semester at the [University of Honk Kong](https://www.hku.hk). 

More details can be found in my [resume](../files/MeunierDimitriResume.pdf).

My interests: approximate Bayesian methods, optimisation (sequential), meta learning, Kernel Methods...
